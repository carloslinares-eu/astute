WFD_S20_rev00
Letâ€™s have a look at the Airbus in-service fleet. In 2018, 2500 aircraft were more than 15 years old, which represented around 20% of the operated aircraft. And this ageing population will keep growing in the coming decades. Based on Airbus projections, in 2028, 7000 in-service aircraft will already have celebrated their fifteenth birthday, representing more than 40% of the operated aircraft. 

WFD_S30_rev00
When the aircraft is ageing, its structures age as well. The main structural phenomena having a growing impact with the aircraft age are Fatigue, Widespread Fatigue Damage known as WFD, corrosion, and also other structural damages such as accidental damage, wear or deterioration.

WFD_S40_rev00
This eLearning module is dedicated to fatigue and WFD mechanisms acting on aircraft metallic structures.
